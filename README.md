### Why Not Just Use AdBlock? Or The Hosts File?
It’s unintuitive, but AdBlock Plus and similar tools actually slow your browser down. These extensions use custom style sheets to strip ads, meaning that every site you look at is edited on the fly. This comes at a cost.

“Adblock, noscript, ghostery, and other addons like them cause 90% of the issues we see in the forums,” said one Chrome developer on Reddit, adding that such extensions increase memory usage anywhere from 10 to 30 per cent, and page load times by between 15 and 50 percent.

This adds up quickly, which is why some power users use the hosts file to block ads instead. This approach is better because it prevents known ad servers from ever being loaded on your computer, meaning your browser doesn’t have to strip ads out. The downside: there are literally thousands of ad servers out there, and these lists need to be maintained and updated on all of your devices. And then there are mobile devices, on which you can’t easily edit the hosts file without rooting or jailbreaking.
